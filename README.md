ðŸ’£ I am studying computer engineering and I believe that this learning will be my whole life.

âš™ Currently learning Vanilla JS. Besides working on my android thesis project with my team-mate.

ðŸŒˆ My interests are NLP, web & mobile development and I want to work in these fields in the future.

ðŸ‘“ When I don't code, my fingers can't stay away from the keyboard, writing about life is my hobby!
